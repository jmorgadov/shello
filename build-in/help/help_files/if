The command 'if' should be use in one of the following ways:

    if [COMMAND] else [COMMAND] end
    if [COMMAND] then [COMMAND] end
    if [COMMAND] then [COMMAND] else [COMMAND] end

    It executes first 'if [COMMAND]', if the exit status of COMMAND 
    is zero then the 'the [COMMAND]' is executed (if it exist). Otherwise
    the 'else [COMMAND]' is executed.

    The exit status of executing an 'if' conditional is equals to the
    exit stauts of the last COMMAND executed.

    Eg.
    
    if echo a then echo b end
    >>> a
    >>> b

    if echo a else echo b end
    >>> a

    A COMMAND can be any list of commands joined by a ';', or it
    could even be another 'if' conditional.

    Eg.

    if echo a; echo b then echo c else echo d end
    >>> a
    >>> b
    >>> c

    if echo a then if echo b else echo c end; echo d else echo e end
    >>> a
    >>> b
    >>> d
