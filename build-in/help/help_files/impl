SHELLO IMPLEMENTATION

    Shello is a shell implementation using a language very smilar
    to bach. 

    LANGUAGE TOKENS:
        Token         Value
        --------------------
        TEXT -------- Texto
        IO_OUT ------ >
        IO_OUT_A ---- >>
        IO_IN ------- <
        LOGIC_AND --- &&
        LOGIC_OR ---- ||
        PIPE -------- |
        SEMICOLON --- ;
        COND_IF ----- if
        COND_ELSE --- else
        COND_THEN --- then
        COND_END ---- end

    LANGUAGE GRAMMAR:

        CMD_LINE := LOGIC_CMD SEMICOLON CMD_LINE
                | LOGIC_CMD

        LOGIC_CMD := PIPED_CMD LOGIC_AND LOGIC_CMD
                | PIPED_CMD LOGIC_OR LOGIC_CMD
                | PIPED_CMD

                | IF_CMD

    PROCESS:

        First the line is getted on the prompt.

        Then all the (not escaped) 'again's commands are replaced by the 
        command it represents on history. (This is done in 'commands.c' 
        file).

        After that, all tokens are genereted. This is done in 'tokenizer.c'
        file).

        The token array is then parsed and all the structs are initialized
        in the correct order. This is done in 'parser.c' file).

        Later the line is added to history. (This is done in 'history.c' file)

        Finally the line is executed. (This is don in 'commands.c' file)

        If any error occurs on one of this process then it is notified and the
        line is not stored on history neither executed.
